# Montagu
## Prerequisites
* [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - at least version 0.17.0
* Python 3 and pip (Python 3 is included with Ubunti. For pip, use `apt install python3-pip`)
* [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html) available on the command line as `vault`, with the address set via `export VAULT_ADDR=https://support.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:8200`
* Your machine needs to trust our Docker Registry. See 
  ["Configuring docker clients to use the registry"](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-ci#configuring-docker-clients-to-use-the-registry)

## Other docs process
* [Release process](ReleaseProcess.md)
* Upgrading and rebooting servers, disaster recovery: [docs](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-machine/tree/master/docs/)
* [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) - potential issues and their solutions, particularly for getting Montagu running on a local dev environment. 

## Deploy

1. Install python packages with `pip3 install --user -r src/requirements.txt`
2. If restoring from backup (or making backups) prepare bb8 with `sudo ./montagu-bb8/bb8/bb8_link_write`
3. `./src/deploy.py`

### Deploy a specific version

```
./deploy.py v0.1.2
```

If the version number is omitted the script will prompt you for one (it must match the pattern of `vX.Y.Z-RCa` where `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `a` are one or more digits.

### Use dockerhub containers
We also have all our released images on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vimc/dashboard/) and the deploy tool can work from there.  This requires VPN access only for the vault, so for test deployments can be done off-site more easily.

```
./deploy.py --docker-hub <version>
```

### Settings
The deploy tool will ask you a series of questions interactively, suggesting
defaults along the way. These settings are saved to `./src/montagu-deploy.json`
and on the next deploy those questions will not be asked. If new settings are
added to the deploy tool, you will just be asked the new questions on your next
deploy.

If you change your mind, you can directly change the values in the json file,
delete the setting in question from the json file (prompting the tool to ask
you just that question again next time you deploy) or delete the whole json file
and go through the full interactive setup again.

#### Test users
If you use the 'test_data' data set then it comes with a default username 
("test.user@imperial.ac.uk") and password ("password")

When deploying to a testing environment using real data restored from live, 
setting the `add_test_user` option to true adds the above user with permissions 
to all modelling groups and reports. 

It will also add a "test.modeller@imperial.ac.uk"
user who has access only to IC-Garske and Harvard-Sweet modelling groups. 

### Static files
To copy file artefacts from the orderly volume into the static volume where
they can be served by the `montagu-static` file server, add a config file to 
the `./static` directory in this repository. File artefacts will be copied into place
following the directory structure of the config file, i.e. artefacts listed in a 
config file placed in `./static/model-review/2019` will be served from
 `/www/model-review/2019`. The config file itself must be a csv where each row contains
 2 entries, the first being a glob identifying file artefacts within the orderly archive,
 the second being the directory to serve matching artefacts from.
 
So if a file at `./static/model-review/2019/config.csv` contains
row ```native-diagnostics-burden-report-drafts/20190131-123847-53fe189e/*,IC-Hallett```
the result is that all files matching the `native-diagnostics-burden-report-drafts/20190131-123847-53fe189e/*` glob
will be served at `model-review/2019/IC-Hallett`

### The montagu user

When deploying to the production server, make sure to first become the
`montagu` user by connecting to production as
`montagu@production.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk`

## Passwords

Database passwords are managed by the vault and laid out as:

```
/secret/vimc/database/:password_group/users/:username
```

Currently our two password groups are `science` and `production`

### Retrieve

To get a database password for use with postgres

```
export PGPASSWORD=$(vault read -field=password secret/vimc/database/science/users/readonly)
psql -h support.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk -U readonly -d montagu
```

This gets the password for the `readonly` user for the `science` password group (which is suitable for the database running on support.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk). To see all users, use:

```
vault list secret/vimc/science/users
```

or

```
vault list secret/vimc/database/production/users
```

### Add a new user

Run

```
./src/generate_passwords.py add_user <username>
```

Passwords can be regenerated by running the script

```
generate_passwords.py regenerate_passwords <group>
```

which will regenerate passwords for one of the password groups.  To create a new password group, use

```
./src/generate_passwords.py create_password_group [--base=BASE] <name>
```

which generates a new set of passwords for the same users as the group specified by `--base` (defaulting to science).

## Development
To update `src/versions.py` to the latest master of each sub repo, use 
`src/update_versions_to_latest_master.py`.

## Fake SMTP Server

If the deployment setting `fake_smtp` is true, a fake SMTP server will be deployed. It provides a web interface at
http://localhost:1080 showing the email requests it has received. It is used by the task queue component to send
notification emails. If `fake_smtp` is false the component will be configured to use the Production SMTP server.  

## Configuration
Configuration of diagnostic reports to run when burden estimates are completed is defined in 
`./container_config/real_diagnostic_reports.yml` This involves a lot of repetition as we currently
run the same diagnostic report for each model, so this file can be regenerated by running 
`./src/generate_real_diagnostic_reports_config.py` - any changes to the required configuration
should be made through this script. 

## Logging

We log to systemd.  All logs will have the tag `DOCKER_TAG=montagu` which allows for filtering with

```
journalctl --since=today CONTAINER_TAG=montagu
journalctl --since=today CONTAINER_NAME=montagu_db_1
```
